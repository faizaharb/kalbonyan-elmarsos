when you want to provid instructions to a computer you use what's called a programming language

ther are hundreds , if not thousands of programming languages available
each made up of it's own syntax or rules and semantics or meaning

languages examples :

c++
#include
int main ()
{
  std::cout << "Hello, World!";
  return 0;
}

javascript
document.write("Hello, World!");

python
print "Hello, World!";



the main reason why we have so many languages is that each comes with it's own set strengths and weaknesses 
some are ideal for programming small devices whith limited memory whereas others were made to handle complex mathematical computations 

regardles of the language you choose ultimately that language has to be brokendown into the only one that computers understand "Machine language"

Machine language is exteremely complex for us to write directly because it's mostly just a series of numbers and this is why we have these other languages that we call high-level languages
