python is an interpreter language 
this means we have to interpret it into machine code

there are three main ways to translate source code into machine code :
1- compile it
2- interpret it
3- combination of both 

typically languages like c ,c++ ,and objective-c are known as compiled languages

whereas php and javascript are known as interpretive languages

and finally java ,c# ,and python use the combination approach
